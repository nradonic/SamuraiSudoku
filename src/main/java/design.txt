    Algorithm:

    Singular loop until there are no more changes
        loop over cells
            is the current cell calculated singular?
                if so promote it in the main grid
                mask off the disallowed cells - calculate effective zones with box overlays
                print out the changed cell and value
        report grid after each loop



    Masking cells with value
        define 9x9 blocks
        check for calculated singles in every 9x9 block
        turn off possibles on 9x9 row, and 9x9 column and 9x9 3x3smallblock
